# Sports

## Vision
A process that automatically creates short form videos that update viewers on high points of sports from the previous day.
Target audience is anyone who wants to know enough about sports to talk about sports, but doesnt have time to watch them all

## Plan
- scrape the headlines from yesterday
- scrape from reddit too?
- read a few articles to get more in depth info
- create a LLM to summarize
- create audio file of ai voice reading
- paste on top of some stock footage
- create a few versions targeted at different demographics
   - one with subway surfers for high schoolers, one with generic sports footage
- combine stock footage with music and ai voice
- post to youtube/tiktok/instagram
- potentially monitize if it grows enough
- because this likely wont make any money I need the cost to be 0
